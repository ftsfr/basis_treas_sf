## Treasury-SF Basis

Treasury-Secured Financing basis spreads in basis points.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| unique_id | Tenor identifier (e.g., Treasury_SF_2Y, Treasury_SF_10Y) |
| ds | Date |
| y | Basis spread in basis points |

### Methodology

$$
\\text{Basis} = (\\text{Treasury Yield} - \\text{SOFR OIS Rate}) \\times 100
$$

### Interpretation

- Basis > 0: Treasuries yield more than SOFR-based financing
- Basis < 0: SOFR-based financing yields more than Treasuries
- Basis = 0: No spread

### Series

Treasury_SF_2Y, Treasury_SF_5Y, Treasury_SF_10Y, Treasury_SF_20Y, Treasury_SF_30Y

### Data Source

Bloomberg Treasury constant maturity yields (USGG series) and SOFR OIS swap rates (USOSFR series)
